# PyValueFragments

Within this repository, I'll drive the development of my python package valuefragments. Maybe someday I'll bring it up to a pypy package.

## Checking

For easy testing, I'll recommend doing an `editable` install via
```bash
sudo python3 - m pip install --upgrade --user --editable .
```
or `make install`.
